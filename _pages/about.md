**About Me**

I'm a soon-to-be final year undergraduate pursuing Electronics Engineering. I enjoy building stuffs, or take things apart to understand how they work. I too like to take part in robotics and automations. This interest had been inside me since my secondary while I'm in my secondary school Robotics Club. 

I hav been participating actively in the club and had been taken part in annually National Robotics Competition (NRC) several times. We did win, but not Champion, but as First Runner-up. The project which me and my teammates built was so great and unforgettable that I'm still feeling proud that we had succesfully built it. Throught here I need to thank my teammates, Zachary Lim Zhao Xing and Tan Chun Tat for being with me during that precious secondary school years.

Let's get back to the topic, I like to participate in competitions, it makes me feel that I'm challenged, as well as training my problem solving skills. In my University, I'm trying to start-up a Makerspace together with Yun Kai. Hopefully it'll go smooth.

**About This Site**

This site is a blogspot where i could share and update (as well as documenting) my previous and future projects. 

I've thinked for a long time what to name my first ever blogspot (or something like that if it isn't =P). Finally until its time up for the decision I came up with this title: Phylixia's Hideout totally out of nowhere. It doesnt have much story behind, but to crack it word-by-word, "Phylixia" was my common-used name normally in Games. Well don't ask me why, it just came itself while I was dreaming someday. 

And about the "Hideout", I think probably I'm more to an introvert person (maybe?), and I found that the world and human beings are too complicated, that I always hope I have a place to hide myself from the complications (and I failed? human being are complicated after all). Maybe that's why the word came up to me.

Combining both word it typically means "My Hideout" for me, feeling like a comfort zone for me (It realy sounds comfortable to me tho). So, it's decided then.

This blog is available thanks to my friend, Yun Kai who is a final year undergraduate in Computer Science, who taught me how to build this page, as well as building cool stuff together.

Thank you for reading =) Have fun exploring
